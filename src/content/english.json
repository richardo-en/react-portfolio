      "description": "Hello, my name is Richard. I am a 21-year-old student of the Slovak Technical University. I like to learn new skills and acquire new knowledge. I am able to adapt to work environments from different fields. I worked on a construction site, as a waiter or worked as a programmer in Slovaneta."

      "description": "My interest in computer science started when I was 17 years old. I came across the 3D modeling software Blender while watching a video about games. I didn't write code in Blender, but I became interested in the process of creating games. I started learning the C# programming language and discovered the Unity software. This led me to create a game called 'Mark Ball' which is available for download on the Google Play Store."

      "title": "Why I chose to study computer science",
      "description": "I chose to study computer science and technology because I have a passion for this field. I am interested in the process of creating software, websites and other computer resources. What I enjoy about this field is that it is enough to learn logical patterns and procedures, which I can then use to create complex projects."

      "description": "As a child, I attended Tilgnerova elementary school. Later, I transferred to St. Uršula Primary School. After elementary school, I decided to focus my education on sports. At the Secondary Sports School in Ružinov, I graduated from compulsory subjects, English, coaching, mathematics. I also graduated from computer science as an additional optional subject. Subsequently, I entered STU FIIT, which I wanted to enter since the third year of high school."

    {
      "title": "My latest experience",
      "description": "During the first year at the university, I gained a lot of new knowledge from practice as well as theoretical information. For example, we learned how larger projects are created, we delved deeper into OOP and the more abstract parts of larger projects. What I learned at school, I could see in the company where I worked. I got my experience in python where I first encountered xml. During school we worked on several projects where we used C, JavaScript, Shell Scripting and I worked with one lecturer on an additional project focused on SEO."

I started studying this language in high school, where I did simple assignments in computer science classes or at home. Subsequently, I tried creating a website with the help of this language, where I also learned descriptive languages. I also used Python during my computer science graduation. After high school, I used python in Slovaneta where I worked in the internal Odoo system.",

I decided to create a game for mobile devices. This is where I encountered Unity and the C# programming language. I then added the game to the google store where it is still available for download. The game is called Mark ball and it is a simple indie game where the player has to pass several levels without colliding into other objects. I could cite experience in this language as my entry into the world of computer science.",

I also dabbled in the Odoo system with the XML language. I would also include work on several wordpress websites, where I changed a few things to suit. I mainly performed SEO optimization on wordpress sites, but as I already mentioned, I also collaborated with a Doctor from the faculty on a project focused on SEO.",

We worked on a web game project developed purely in Javascript. The project had to have a certain structure and had to meet certain conditions. I really liked this language as it is very similar to Python. I would like to continue working on Javascript, so I decided to start this portfolio using React.",

Right after the start of the University, I joined Slovanet as an intern. We worked on the internal Odoo system, where I got my first experience in the company. I learned how IT-oriented teams work in the company, I encountered organizing tasks and working out these tasks by certain deadlines. I had the opportunity to watch and learn from the experienced leaders of our teams or to take some responsibility for the work that was assigned to me. This job position gave me a lot of experience, for which I am grateful. After the internship in Slovaneta, I worked as a waiter for 4 months, where I learned to better handle stress and pressure in the work environment.",
